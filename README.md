## Description:
This project's primary purpose is creating a GUI interacting with mySQL database with basic functions and simple graphics.

-------

## How to use:
Before you launch:
- Require MySQL Server and Workbench 8.0+.
- Install all Python libraries listed in 'tests/requirements.txt' using pip.
- Go to file '.env' in folder 'app/db/', then edit it with notepad, make sure all variables are matched with your own database (no need quotation marks).
- Runs all MySQL scripts (.sql) in folders 'db/' and 'queries/'.

Lauch the GUI:
- Go to folder 'app/' and run 'main.py'.

-------

## IMPORTANT:
The GUI runs in resolution 1600x900 (Does not support dynamic-scaling but can be added in future updates).\
Make sure your device is set to that resolution at least.
